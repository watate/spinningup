Hi!
===
I forked openAI's spinningup library and changed some of the code to enable saving and restoring tensorflow checkpoints and computation graphs. ExperimentGrid is also used in my "Gym" folder to practice with the different gym environments provided by OpenAI

**Note to self**: Open terminal in spinningup folder and use 'git push -u myrep' to push changes I've made to this repository
